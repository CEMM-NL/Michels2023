R and Python code for the manuscript 

In the associated GitHub repository, you will find both the R and Python code used for conducting the primary analyses presented in the paper titled "Host Response Changes and Their Association with Mortality in COVID-19 Patients with Lymphopenia."

We have made diligent efforts to ensure the clarity of the code in both R and Python to facilitate easy replication. However, should you have any inquiries or require assistance with the code, please don't hesitate to reach out to us at e.h.michels@amsterdamumc.nl. We are committed to addressing any questions you may have at our earliest convenience.
